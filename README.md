# Password_Generator
Password Generator is a simple application that can randomly generate passwords with a combination of letters, numbers and special characters based on a length given by the user using Python Tkinter module. The user can store the password along with their username in a database using Python SQLite3 module. The program only accepts users whose usernames have not been previously stored.
